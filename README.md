Just another repository


Hello world! I'm new to the coding/programming world. I've spent the last 3 months learning some frontend development. I've come to find programming to be quite difficult yet exciting. 

I'm a Jamaican native based in the US, currently looking to to pursue CS degree. I enjoy anime and deadlifting.
